# Additional corpora

- work in progress -

The following statistics are for the additional corpora of the "Redewiedergabe" corpus which will be added soon.
The additional materials contain: (1) single annotated samples, (2a) fully annotated narratives, (2b) fully annotated non-fictional articles, (3) additional corpus indirect, (4) additional corpus free indirect

# 1 single annotated samples

This corpus contains the same type of samples as the main corpus. In contrast, the samples here are annotated by only one annotator.

# STWR instances
The following tables list the number of annotated STWR instances in the corpus. These instances vary greatly in length, between one token (possible for STWR types direct and reported) and several sentences (possible for STWR types direct, freeIndirect and indirect/freeIndirect.)

## STWR types
| Type                    | Number of instances | Percent of all annotated STWR instances|
|------------------------|--------|---------|
| direct                 | 4166   | 33.2%   |
| indirect               | 2669   | 21.3%   |
| free indirect          |  136   | 1.1%    |
| reported               | 5431   | 43.3%   |
| indirect/free indirect |  131   | 1.0%    |
| total                 | 12,533  |         |

## STWR medium
| Medium  | Number of instances | Percent of all annotated STWR instances |
|---------|--------|---------|
| speech  | 8077   | 64.4%   |
| thought | 2917   | 23.3%   |
| writing | 1129   | 9.0%    |
| ambig   | 410    | 3.3%    |
| total  | 12,533   |         |

## Average length of instances, in relation to STWR type and fictionality

|                    | number of instances | average length of instances | number of instances | average length of instances |
|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
|                    | fictional           | fictional                   | non-fictional       | non-fictional               |
| direct             | 3527                | 22.2                        | 639                 | 39.5                        |
| indirect           | 1424                | 12.4                        | 1245                | 18.4                        |
| free ind           | 132                 | 26.4                        | 4                   | 14.0                        |
| indirect/ free ind | 65                  | 32.8                        | 66                  | 31.7                        |
| reported           | 2778                | 8.0                         | 2653                | 11.2                        |

The average length varies between ST&WR types and between fictional vs. non-fictional texts. While _free indirect_ and _indirect/free indirect_ are too infrequent to draw robust conclusions, it is interesting to note that for the three remaining types the instances in non-fictional texts are longer on average. 

# STWR token percentages

The graphics show the distribution of types and media in fictional vs. non-fictional samples, based on tokens.

## STWR types

![rw_Types](/resources/docs/img/rw_type.png)

Direct and free indirect ST&WR are clearly more common in fictional texts. Free indirect even occurs almost exclusively there, but is very infrequent in general, due to the historical nature of our corpus. Indirect and reported ST&WR on the other hand are more frequent in non-fictional texts, though the difference is not as pronounced.

## STWR medium

![rw_Media](/resources/docs/img/rw_medium.png)

The graphic only shows the most frequent ambigous category "speech/writing" (ambigous between speech and writing). The other ambigous combinations are much less frequent.

Speech representation is dominant in fictional texts and writing in non-fictional ones. The latter is due to book reviews and to written communication often being a topic in news stories. The high percentage of speech/writing also indicates that the medium tends to be underspecified and probably considered less important than the represented content in non-fiction.
