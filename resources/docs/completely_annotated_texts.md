# completely annotated texts

The following statistics are for the completely annotated texts as additional data of the "Redewiedergabe" corpus. Tokenization was performed with [CAB](https://kaskade.dwds.de/demo/cab/file) available via [Deutsches Textarchiv](http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de) (see also [Column-based text format](column_based_text_format.md)).
This sub-corpus contains completely annotated texts, annotated by only one annotator. Annotation types and metadata are similar to the main corpus.
